                    <h1>THE DARK SECRET (IRA DIVINA)</h1>
                <p>
                    "It was a good time for all creatures of the earth, <br>
                    but fate decreed that the dark prophecy of a <br>
                    demon knight could bring a tragic end to this peace <br>
                    scarring their lives forever. Shortly before his <br>
                    defeat in the last of the primordial wars between <br>
                    the heavens and hells the evil son of the Hell God <br>
                    Kron, known as Nekron, withdrew to his lair in the underworld. <br><br>

                    There, sensing his impending deathhe inscribed <br>
                    a testament of pure evil in seven black books. <br>
                    One by one six of these books were discovered through out the ages, <br>
                    however the seventh, last and most <br>
                    terrible of all contained the secret of his resurrection. <br>
                    He commanded seven immortal demons to carry out his dark plan. <br>
                    But they were turned into stone by the angels of the crystal realms. <br>
                    And so his dreams slept with them until a time came <br>
                    when the forces of evil would usurp the earth. <br>
                    Nekron would rule in the unholy name! of cosmic chaos. <br>
                    And this time he would reign supreme!" <br><br>

                    Ira divina <br>
                    A dolore nunc libera nos <br>
                    Tacet rota temporis <br>
                    Nunc est silentium <br>
                    Sempiternus angelus <br>
                    A malo libera nos <br>
                    A malo

                    <h1>UNHOLY WARCRY</h1>
                <p>
                    In the dark lies a secret <br>
                    in the mystic seventh black book <br>
                    Nekron's dark words <br><br>

                    He is Kron, Kron's disciple <br>
                    he is sworn to return <br>
                    to avenge the lost divine wars <br><br>

                    Algalord arise, greater than before <br>
                    time of peace, not of war <br>
                    shouts of freedom from the castle's walls <br>
                    freedom in the land and <br>
                    hope for all... hope for all <br><br>

                    Into the silent, dark and forgotten <br>
                    caves of Dar-Kunor <br>
                    deep in the secret book is awaiting <br>
                    unholy Warcry <br>
                    Nekron promised bloody terror <br>
                    bringing death and hate to the new world <br><br>

                    From the rocky mountains to the golden sea <br>
                    to the barbarians' sacred hills <br>
                    from the icy north and misty lakes <br>
                    to the walls of Seth and elvish plains <br>
                    all beware! <br><br>

                    Into the silent, dark and forgotten <br>
                    caves of Dar-Kunor <br>
                    deep in the secret book is awaiting <br>
                    unholy Warcry <br>
                    Nekron promised bloody terror <br>
                    bringing death and hate to the new world <br><br>

                    Torment, pain and bloody rain... Nekron's resurrection <br>
                    they must kill the demon king or fight another war <br>

                    "Only one person could crossed the darklands sorrounding Hargor <br>
                    and venture forth deep into the caves of Dar-Kunor... <br>
                    his is a name the world will never forget... <br>
                    he is Dargor!"

                    He is the chosen one <br>
                    he walked out through the darkness <br>
                    he met the wisdom's light <br>
                    chosen to find the last dark rhymes <br>
                    the last rhymes of hell <br><br>

                    He is Kron, Kron's disciple <br>
                    he is sworn to return <br>
                    to avenge the lost divine wars <br><br>

                    There was only one who knew the way <br>
                    he lived in the dark, lonely caves <br>
                    the demon of the night could save the day <br>
                    should they take a chance or run away... <br>
                    dargor was his name! <br><br>

                    Into the silent, dark and forgotten <br>
                    caves of Dar-Kunor <br>
                    deep in the secret book is awaiting <br>
                    unholy Warcry <br><br>

                    Now they swore to band together <br>
                    on a sacred journey <br>
                    called by fate, time to be great <br>
                    unholy Warcry <br>
                    Nekron promised bloody terror <br>
                    bringing death and hate to the new world

                    In primordial times of sorrow <br>
                    ancient ages of the known world <br>
                    Kron's reign of terror was rising <br>
                    so the Skylords sent their angels <br>
                    against the storm that treathened heavens <br>
                    seven wars were so fought <br>
                    the dead rose <br>
                    led by the Darklords of Hell <br><br>

                    The last war <br>
                    meant the end <br>
                    of hellgod's <br>
                    old reign <br><br>

                    Dark memories lost in the shades of illusion <br>
                    warn the light of electric sky <br>
                    the angels could change the life on earth <br>
                    but not the demons' old plans <br>
                    united force of strong wise men... <br>
                    a new order soon was born <br>
                    ten kings, ten wizards, elves and dragonlords <br>
                    ready to fight, to fight for their world <br><br>

                    Ready to face the last secret <br>
                    hidden for 5000 angel's years <br>
                    5000 years <br><br>

                    A great and new hope in Elgard was born <br>
                    the one hope that could finally find the... <br>
                    sacred words to stop the dark plan of Nekron <br>

                    to Dar-Kunor's forgotten entrance <br><br>

                    For two days they walked in the wild <br>
                    on the pathway to darkness <br>
                    the reason they survived, it was Dargor <br><br>

                    Finally they saw in the black and evil marsh <br>
                    there lied the passageway between snakes and hellish mud <br><br>

                    Shadows of death <br>

                    (Into the black icy water) <br>
                    black icy water <br><br>

                    he found the caves of the ancient brother elves <br><br>

                    <h1>NIGHTFALL ON THE GREY MOUNTAINS</h1>
                <p>
                    Holy angels of eternal light <br>
                    you who fell in the primordial age <br>
                    between these dark and grey lonely mountains <br>
                    who died to protect the green of the earth <br><br>

                    For Algalord and Elgard, Thorald and Elnor <br>
                    for all the towns of the known world <br>
                    for the icy northlands, the waterfalls kingdom <br>
                    the dwarves' western realms and the whole middle lands <br><br>

                    Cold mystic night - it falls on the plain <br>
                    on the grey mountains reigsn now the shade <br>
                    angals of light give them the faith <br>
                    time now has come, Dar-Kunor awaits <br><br>

                    Unknown threat - it fills the dry air <br>
                    the howling of wolwes fades behind them <br>
                    they try to find rest between the wild rocks <br>
                    the one they'll soon see can be their last dawn <br><br>

                    The angels' lament breaths in the cold wind <br>
                    wispers of death sourround the wide marsh <br>
                    Dar-Kunor is there to swallow their souls <br>
                    in front of them another hells gate <br><br>

                    Cold mystic night - it falls on the plain <br>
                    on the grey mountains reigsn now the shade <br>
                    angals of light give them the faith <br>
                    time now has come, Dar-Kunor awaits
