                    so people are calling the brave and his sword <br>
                    no time left to save the wise throne <br>
                    shades of a past not so far to forget <br>
                    the rise of the demons from their bloody hell <br>
                    so come mighty warrior to light the lost hope <br>

                    is pounding in him as a terrific quake <br>
                    you're closer and closer now follow their smell <br>

                    Tragic and furious the clash of the steel of the gods <br>
                    and so magic the power, the sword in his valorous hands <br>
                    oceans of fire are blasting the throne of the demons <br>
                    and from distant red skies the thunders are calling his name <br>
                    the name of the master of pain <br><br>

                    For Ancelot, the ancient cross of war <br>

                    from the highest mountains the water falls <br>
                    flowers and plants now caress my eyes <br>
                    Along these holy valleys kissed by light <br>
                    and I am victim of this spell <br>
                    wonderful symphony of enchanted lands... <br>
                    wonderful symphony of enchanted lands... <br><br>

                    The whisper of spring is now carried by winds <br>
                    the winds from the land of the fire <br>
                    where peace is a gift from the king of the kings <br>
                    it seems so strongly unreal... unreal! <br><br>

                    Dragons and demons beware! <br>
                    It's the rage of the titans... <br>
                    Is the titans' bloody rage! <br>
                    Warlords and steelgods beware! <br>
                    It's the rage of the titans... <br>
                    Is the titans' bloody rage, bloody rage! <br><br>

                    The oak, my sister, smiles at the sun <br>
                    Now free from the weight of winter <br>
                    The eagles fly from mountain to mountain <br>
                    Enchanting my heart... brave heart! <br><br>

                        The seven red flames of the cave <br>
                        are lightning the horrible torture <br>
                        constricted to see the regrets <br>
                        to have had the life from his god <br>
                        Airin sheds black tears supporting the terrible rape <br>
                        the fury of the sons of the thunder <br>
                        is breaking the mystical chain <br><br>
    
                        Arwald falls so to his knees <br>
                        while Akron the black king is laughing <br>
                        the princess falls down on the stones <br>
                        with no breath of life anymore <br>
                        may your ambition lead you to the unholy name <br>

                        flies the last winged unicorn <br>
                        with its magic breath of innocence <br>
                        rising to the crystal throne <br><br>
    
                        Skies are spitting holy fire wisdom cries and deadly whispers flow <br>
                        flow down to silent mystic shores <br>
                        shores of the spirits thirst for vengeance waiting for their holy crystal gate <br>
                        gate to the sunny holy lands <br><br>
    
                        "Lands of a timeless world... <br>

                        tears of blood and sadness formed the wonderful silent lake <br>
                        swans and birds in water games will call Airin's name... her name! <br><br>
    
                        And now is the time to decide <br>
                        on a way to escape from the cavern <br>
                        the old silver chains on the wall <br>
                        are now also trapping their souls <br>
                        Airin my princess I can not endure all my pain <br>
                        but I swear to you on my proud name... <br>
