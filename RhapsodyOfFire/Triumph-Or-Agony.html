                    Vision of darkness, mad gothic splendour <br>
                    rhyme of primordial neverending war <br>
                    carved in the wild rock under the ghost town <br>
                    sun of the darklands, black pride of Kron <br><br>

                    200 nor of unholy stone <br>
                    speak through the tears of desperate souls <br>
                    legend and myth will never reveal <br>
                    the infinite pain behind Nekron's will <br>

                    Wars of the underworld <br>
                    fought by our brothers who'll never return <br>

                    Broken emotions wet from the shy rain <br>
                    lords of the lost time dream of great revenge <br>
                    no chance for mind's rest, fear in the dawn's breath <br>
                    what they will soon find can be just their death <br><br>

                        many legends told by the jesters <br>

                        the elves found shelter between these wild rocks <br>
                        at that time this region known as Irith <br>
                        was green, majestic, heaven on earth <br>
                        when the sixth war was sadly lost <br>
                        for elves and unicorns this meant the fall <br>
                        Nekron found a new reign to rule <br>
                        so woods and flowers decided to die <br>

                    <h1>THE MYTH OF THE HOLY SWORD</h1>
                    <p>
                        After the victory of the angels over hell <br>
                        these old lands became a new reason for war <br>
                        elves and men all united against new darklords <br>
                        it's the time of the three elvish wars <br><br>
    
                        During the third one in Galfor's old mines <br>
                        naimur was captured by Akron, 'Hell's Fury' <br>
                        he got tortured by the darklord with an Emerald Stone <br>
                        and his brother left alone with a bleeding soul <br><br>
    
                        He took the stone, he forged a sword <br>
                        and he asked to the Angels to fill it with might <br>
                        so it was born <br>
                        The Myth of the Holy Sword, and he asked to the Angels <br>
                        to fill it with might <br>
                        so it was born <br><br>
    
                        After some years the elves' new attack <br>
                        dramatic battles and rivers of blood <br>
                        and for Loinir came the chance to avenge Naimur's death <br>
                        just a strike of the sword Hell's last breath <br><br>
    
                        He felt too much power in that blade <br>
                        he gave it to the wizards to <br>
                        discover why And the wizards knew right away <br>
                        that sword could have been a threat <br>
                        in the hands of the wrong man or darklord <br><br>
    
                        The wizards knew, the sword was filled <br>
                        With the glory of Angels, who enchanted the blade<br>
                        they hide it well beyond the Ivory Gates <br>
                        with the glory of Angels, who enchanted the blade <br>
                        They hide it well <br><br>
    
                        Vita e morte Spazio e tempo <br>
                        sulla sacra Lama divina <br><br>

                        You know well what happened then <br>
                        the Loregard's warrior and his quest <br>
                        he was the chosen to find the blade <br>
                        far beyond the mystic gates <br><br>
    
                        Akron's army could be stopped <br>
                        thanks to that Holy Sword <br>
                        now it lies somewhere deep <br>
                        in the Algalord's raging sea <br><br>
    
                        And he asked to the Angels, to fill it with might <br>
                        so it was born <br>

                    <p>
                        Ascolta ancora il vento <br>
                        che in disparte mi accarezza <br>
                        dimenticato pianto <br>
                        prigioniero della sera <br>
                        pianto, dimenticato pianto <br>
                        prigioniero della sera <br>
                        un respiro sempre accenso <br>
                        seguo e cerco lentamente <br>
                        nel sospiro del destino <br><br>
    
                        Vivo per te, sogno di te <br>
                        canto di te<br>
                        nel cielo incastrata <br>
                        timida stella morente <br><br>
    
                        Di canzoni dimenticate <br>
                        dai tuoi occhi gia' vissute <br>
                        ora vivo e mi consolo...vivo... <br>
                        Il mio tempo, nella mani <br>
                        nel tuo viso il mio tormento <br>
                        Il silenzio, il mio domani <br>
                        ancorato ad un momento <br>
    
                        Vivo per te, sogno di te <br>
                        canto di te<br>

                        timida stella morente <br><br>
    
                        Vissuti dolcemente <br>
                        sogni di un'etera notte <br>
                        ora bruciano traditi <br>
                        dalle nostre memorie <br>
                        lazrime, lacrime di rabbia <br>
                        nel mio cuore sempre accese <br>
                        parlano, parlano le onde <br>
                        di un porto ormai svanito <br><br>
    
                        Vivo per te, sogno di te <br>
                        canto di te<br>

                    The fall of hope of illusion <br>
                    is hidden there behind the wild rocks <br>

                    While I crossed the mountain's side <br>
                    I recalled a memory <br>
                    days of anguish, nights of pain <br>
                    your voice lives on trapped inside my mind <br>
                    eternally <br><br>

                    Those wise last words fade in my soul <br>
                    "You had the choice, you chose the light <br>

                    Hell's lost flame was life for me <br>

                    I was under and evil spell <br>

                    Into the darkness they crossed the marsh <br>
                    and entered the frozen cave <br>
                    a secret path was cut into the rock <br>
                    a labyrinth a twisted maze <br>
                    an unknown misty haze <br><br>

                    Open your heart <br>
                    then your mind's eye <br><br>

                    Khaas' eyes focused on the grey rock <br>
                    he saw it in a different way <br>
                    the riddle soon would be solved <br>
                    an illusion was carved in the stone <br>

                    so deep the cave of bats <br>
                    but they will go on and on <br><br>

                    They are the last hope <br>

                    spirits of the forest <br>

                    The well of dead souls appears, a red river's flowing inside <br>
                    there's no way to cross, there's no way to climb <br>
                    they wish they were birds and could fly <br>
                    fly to the other side <br><br>

                    There's a message <br>
                    on the dark stone <br><br>

                    They discovered a massive dark stone <br>
                    atop it a riddle inscribed: <br>
                    "Walk in the bloody abyss, led onward by Nekron's black will. <br>
                    find the courage in his name" <br><br>

                    Search your conscience <br>
                    read between those words <br><br>

                    "Yes, and now I know. Nekron's name is all <br>
                    that we need to solve this mystery" <br>
                    Iras spoke those holy words <br><br>

                    into Dar-Kunor, new saga begins <br><br>

                    "And so this new riddle finally revealed itself to me <br>
                    the solution lay in Nekron's name <br>
                    in the Nekranos alphabet certain numbers <br>
                    corresponding to the letters of his name <br><br>

                    Aligned in accordance with black geometry enabling us <br>
                    to walk on invisible steps across the silent abyss <br>
                    reaching the other side of the cave. <br>
                    unknown horrors awaited us behind those two dark portals" <br><br>

                    By all the gods of my nordic lands... <br>
                    we are at the gates of death... <br><br>

                    They were built with the severed limbs of humans and elves <br>
                    ...Under the orders of my father Vankar... <br>
                    I can feel suffering in every rock... <br>
                    listen to the silence... <br>
                    that must be the great hall... <br>
                    the unholy place where the Black Order was born... <br><br>

                    Since 5000 years, age of primordial wars <br>
                    the men of the known world read Nekron's manuscripts <br>
                    power, blood and luxury attracted some of them <br>
                    who denied the gift of light, sealed their bloody faith to... <br><br>

                    Hell, Kron and his son <br>
                    he revealed to them the key to resurrect his soul <br>
                    he would be the avenger of his death <br>
                    Nekron once dead would survive in their faith <br><br>

                    Here they came <br>
                    to pray for him <br>
                    a new Black Order <br><br>

                    Dar-Kunor was a gathering of fools <br>
                    evil seed for new <br>
                    tragic wars <br><br>

                    Sacrifice of innocents, darkest rites with human flesh <br>
                    this was written in the books seven like the sins of men <br>
                    but horror fills the one that keeps the most terrible prophecy <br>
                    with it Nekron gave the key to awaken him from sleep <br><br>

                    Sad, dark, prophecy <br>
                    our heroes have to find it <br>
                    or the world will suffer <br>
                    the last book contains another key <br><br>

                    All the wizards know <br>
                    the seventh book's the only hope <br><br>

                    There may be a key <br>
                    in the seventh Book <br>
                    a message for the evil Order <br><br>

                    How to hide <br>
                    the Angels' rhymes <br>
                    so they never will be seen again <br><br>

                    Great lords of thunder... the seventh lost book... there... <br>
                    upon the altar... <br><br>

                    Yes... that is the book... I am sure of it! <br>
                    I've heard my father describe it many times... <br><br>

                    Let us take it and leave this godforsaken place... <br><br>

                    ...The legendary evil book is now in our hands... <br>
                    let us make haste... this was too easy <br><br>

                    What are these noises? <br>
                    what's happening... <br>
                    what's going on? <br><br>

                    Removing it has awakened some nameless horror <br>
                    ...Let us leave here now... <br>
                    look... there! ...hands coming up from the ground... <br>
                    ahhh... come on... get away from here... let's move! <br><br>

                    Scene di vita, eroica memoria <br>
                    verso la luce della speranza <br>
                    nel cieco oblio della lor fuga <br>
                    nel grigio limbo tra vita e morte <br><br>

                    "Fleeing through the labyrinths with the hordes of the living dead <br>
                    fast upon them <br>
                    once again they found themselves trapped in front of the abyss <br><br>

                    But with no time to think about black geometry <br>
                    they leaped into the red river <br>
                    for any death would have been better than the one waiting for them <br>
                    created by the hungry creatures of darkness" <br><br>

                    Ossa e fango <br>
                    ma il respiro c'è <br><br>

                    Covered by skulls and bones <br>
                    in Hargor's marsh they found a way to hide <br>
                    from the sons of darkness <br>
                    who betrayed the Angels' light <br><br>

                    They are the last hope <br>
                    for men, dragons and dwarves <br>
                    spirits of the forest <br>
                    shy elves and trolls <br><br>

                    Five went from Elgard <br>
                    into the darkness leaving the light <br>
                    to find the Black Order's <br>
                    immortal dark rhymes <br><br>

                    To find the written words <br>
                    of Hellgod's unholy son <br>
                    prevent him from returning <br>
                    and save the whole world <br><br>

                    Finally out of the dark <br>
                    they see the light of the moon <br>
                    they stole from Dar-Kunor <br>
                    the seventh Black Book.

                        Then they found the river <br>
                        that led them to Fenor <br>
                        onward down to Orin <br>
                        orin was their shelter <br>
