                    <p> I crossed the valleys the dust of midlands <br>
                    to search for the third key to open the gates <br>
                    now I'm near the altar the secret inside <br>
                    as legend told my beloved sunlight the dragon's eyes <br>
                    on the way to the glory I'll honor my sword <br>
                    to serve right ideals and justice for all <br><br> 

                    Finally, happened the sun lit their eyes <br>
                    the spell was creating strange games of light <br>
                    thanks to hidden mirrors I found my lost way <br>
                    over the stone I reached the place it was a secret cave <br>
                    in a long bloody battle that prophecies told <br>
                    the light will prevail hence wisdom is gold <br><br>

                    For the king for the land for the mountains <br>
                    for the green valleys where dragons fly <br>
                    for the glory the power to win the black lord <br>
                    I will search for the emerald sword <br><br>

                    Only a warrior with a clear heart <br>
                    could have the honour to be kissed by the sun <br>
                    yes, I am that warrior, I followed my way <br>
                    led by the force of cosmic souls I can reach the sword <br>
                    on the way to the glory, I'll honor my sword <br>
                    to serve right ideals and justice for all <br><br>

                    For the king for the land for the mountains <br>

                <p> Removed the stones which hide the cave <br>
                    blind and dark along my way <br>
                    I must go on wise and brave before a last hail <br>
                    at the end of floor stairs of ancient stone <br>
                    lead me to a vision, an unreal hall <br><br>

                    And they appear in front of me <br>
                    lightened by a mystic flame <br>
                    a new dimension I have to face beyond the gates <br>
                    I can not believe on what now I see <br>
                    when the two demons awake from the sleep <br><br>

                    Holy dragons keepers of time <br>
                    ride brave the blue skies and spell my eyes <br>
                    fly beyond these hills ride on the wind <br>
                    the wisdom of the kings <br><br>

                    Lost in a dream I'm under the spell <br>
                    of the sunny magic land <br>
                    but Aresius said: become aware! all can hide the hell... <br>
                    now it's time to go to the mighty sword <br>
                    it's time to follow the kings holy call <br><br>

                    Holy dragons keepers of time <br>
                    ride brave the blue skies and spell my eyes <br>
                    fly beyond these hills ride on the wind <br>
                    the wisdom of the kings <br><br>

                    Holy dragons keepers of time <br>
                    ride brave the blue skies and spell my eyes <br>
                    fly beyond these hills ride on the wind <br>

                <p> Yes, mighty warrior... <br>
                    what you hear now are the suffering voices of all the heroes <br>
                    that crossed these lands before you <br><br>
                    they ended their tragically <br>
                    but their thirst for victory is still alive <br>
                    and breathers through these ancient rocks<br>
                    corroded by the fury of the wind <br>
                    their pride now rides with you...

                <p> Echoes of terror in this old land <br>
                    I see the result of their quest <br>
                    skulls of old heroes lie everywhere <br>
                    in this mystical place <br>
                    dust in their eyes, dust on my pride <br>
                    in this infinite journey to the ancient sword <br><br>

                    I can hear their lament between these rocks <br>
                    the whisper of an angry ghost <br>
                    he speaks for them all trapped in this lost world <br>
                    I am their very last hope <br>
                    to ride from hell free once again <br>
                    to break the chains from a bloody past for my victory <br><br>

                    Eternal glory ride fast to me <br>
                    pound in my heart for the Algalord kings <br>
                    eternal glory spread your wide wings <br>
                    fly and forever lead my holy steel <br><br>

                    I'll fight, I'll cry for your silence your name <br>
                    you'll live through me I will end all your pain <br>
                    for the swan in the lake the bird on the tree <br>
                    the peace for my beloved lands <br><br>

                    The black king is near and Algalord calls <br>
                    so heroes of the lost valley raise all your voice <br><br>

                    Eternal glory ride fast to me <br>
