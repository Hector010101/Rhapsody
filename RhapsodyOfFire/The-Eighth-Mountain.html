                <p>
                    Prison of fire, burning in hell <br>
                    Infernal choirs whisper a spell <br>
                    The reign of the demons is craving for blood <br>
                    Ain't no place for heroes, ain't no place for god <br>
                    Pain is so deep that I'll fight till the end of time <br><br>

                    Hey nameless creature beware of my sword! <br>
                    Why do you crave for my bloody soul? <br>
                    "Cause I can redeem you... And this is the deal: <br>
                    Seven heroic deeds... Just take it or leave" <br>
                    Now there's no choice: I will sign and I'll serve you <br><br>

                    <h1>WARRIOR HEART</h1>
                <p>
                    Once more battle, think it's my last stand <br>
                    A lost soul is begging me raising his poor flickering hand <br><br>

                    Should I not care for his silent cry? <br>
                    The honor, at least, will prevail <br>
                    We've never been friends but I won't close my eyes <br>
                    We lost our family to serve our flag <br><br>

                    Under the steel of my enemy's armor is beating the same warrior heart <br>
                    And though we both know how to kill without fear... <br>
                    We don't care if the world falls apart <br>
                    And once in a while you will see me cry <br><br>

                    Silence is everywhere, cold: the voices of death <br>
                    Even the birds forgot how to sing <br>
                    Struggling for one last breath <br> <br>

                    How could I be so disgustingly blind? <br>
                    Emotions are always the same <br>
                    We've grown up apart <br>
                    We lived separate worlds <br>
                    But day and night live together and tamed <br><br>

                    Under the steel of my enemy's armor is beating the same warrior heart <br>
                    And though we both know how to kill without fear... <br>
                    We don't care if the world falls apart <br>
                    And once in a while you will see me cry <br> <br>

                    Under the steel of my enemy's armor is beating the same warrior heart <br>
                    And though we both know how to kill without fear... <br>
                    We don't care if the world falls apart <br>
                    And once in a while you will see me cry <br><br>

                    'Cause... Under the steel there's a hero like me <br>
                    Who is sharing the same warrior heart <br>
                    I know we belong to this world full of fear <br>
                    Face to cafe with the scars you can't hide <br>
                    And once in a while there's no shame in tears

                    <h1>THE COURAGE TO FORGIVE</h1>
                    <p>
                        Ten years gone by since you've gone and I still hate what you did <br>
                        To my life to my soul, father why? Why... <br><br>
    
                        Ten years you wasted to shape your own son, to grow the perfect warrior <br>
                        Ten stones on my back are crushing my bones, they're bending my spine <br>
                        I'll get over it: I'll destroy my hate <br><br>
    
                        Hard is the path when the memory makes you grieve <br>
                        Painful, the memories are painful like a wound <br>
                        Leave the past behind, find the courage to forgive <br>
                        Painful, the memories are painful <br>
                        It's your duty, the contract says: "You have to forgive" <br><br>
    
                        Shadows of the war, a shield, a sword: despite my young age they were my close friends <br>
                        Despite my hands were made to play, I learned how to kill... but why? <br><br>
    
                        Life is a labyrinth of chances and leaps of faith, an endless dreaming <br>
                        Maybe I wouldn't become brave like you, as strong as you were <br>
                        I'll try to forget: I'll destroy my hate <br><br>
    
                        Hard is the path when the memory makes you grieve <br>
                        Painful, the memories are painful like a wound <br>
                        Leave the past behind, find the courage to forgive <br><br>
    
                        Painful, the memories are painful <br>
                        It's your duty, the contract says: "You have to forgive" <br>
                        All the stars can't ignite the dark <br>
                        I will burn my anger just to see the light, to rise again <br><br>
    
                        Hard is the path when the memory makes you grieve <br>
                        Painful, the memories are painful like a wound <br>
                        Leave the past behind, find the courage to forgive <br>
                        Painful, the memories are painful <br>
                        It's your duty, the contract says: "You have to forgive"

                    <p>
                        Look at the dawn, shining <br>
                        Clouds and mountains <br>
                        The cold morning wind makes <br>
                        Me tear and think of you <br>
                        Let me breathe it once more, <br>
                        This time without chains <br>
                        Let me feel once more how <br>
                        Much life you have on your lips <br>
                        So kiss me <br><br>
    
                        Look at the dawn, <br>
                        It could be the last time <br>
                        The march has begun <br>
                        Gates of steel and gold <br>
                        The tyrant of Konstrukts <br>
                        This evening will fall <br>
                        Unrightful king of the throne <br>
                        The Nephilim's henchmen <br>
                        Will pay for all <br>
                        691 sons were killed <br>
                        Without mercy <br>
                        So justice will come <br><br>
    
                        Trust in me as a leader, <br>
                        Don't be afraid <br>
                        We will march for brothers <br>
                        And sisters murdered <br>
                        Trust in me, together we'll win <br>
                        Oculus domini <br>

                        Freedom for the brave, <br>
                        Hand-to-hand's what we crave <br>
                        Riding for the land so <br>
                        These rocks will turn to sand <br>
                        The tales will recall this glorious day <br><br>
    
                        We struck evil guardians, <br>
                        They were flying blind <br>
                        The only chance to <br>
                        Break through the walls <br>
                        Rain made of arrows and stones <br>
                        Our shields were enchained, <br>
                        Unbreakable chrome <br><br>
    
                        Trust in me as your leader <br>
                        So we won't fail <br>
                        We will march, the traitors <br>
                        Tonight will dine in hell <br>
                        You'll see, together we'll win <br>
                        Oculus domini <br>
                        Nobili animo <br><br>

                        The tales will recall this glorious day <br><br>
    
                        When all seems so lost <br>
                        The will can change your hope <br>
                        A warrior I know from the <br>
                        East now is coming <br>
                        He'll help us 'cause I spared his life <br>
                        Like earthquake and storm we <br>
                        Will scorch all this earth <br>
                        And together we'll push deep the knife <br>
                        The tyrant tonight surely dies <br><br>
    
                        So their fortress is burning and the <br>
                        Wine will flow with the songs <br>
                        So raise your sword, the tyrant <br>
                        Tonight will dine in hell <br>
                        Let's play the bells, let the world <br>
                        Know we won, we're free <br>

                        It's hard to get over mind fields <br>
                        You can't control inner instincts <br><br>
    
                        Vividi sogni di oscure realtà <br> 
                        Mercy and agony: two halves, one burning soul <br>
                        Hell walks beside me while Heaven sends his calling <br><br>
    
                        The truth is so scary, mean cold and rough <br>
                        Oh God please forgive me, I did it for love <br>
                        Save my soul, you omniscient <br>
                        You know I saved my dove <br><br>
    
                        There's no gain just hate <br>
                        This suffering came from the conscience <br>
                        There's no escape from your penance <br>
                        The tales of a hero's fate <br>
                        It's hard to get over mind fields <br>
                        You can't control inner instincts <br><br>
    
                        Vividi sogni di oscure realtà <br>
                        Mercy and agony: two halves, one burning soul <br>
                        Hell walks beside me while Heaven sends his calling <br><br>
    
                        Why am I here? Oh, what does this mean?  <br>
                        There's nothing right there's nothing wrong <br>
                        I'll live forever damned... the tales of a hero's fate <br><br>
    
                        Vividi sogni di oscure realtà <br>
                        Mercy and agony: two halves, one burning soul <br>
                        Hell walks beside me while Heaven sends his calling <br><br>
    
                        Why? <br>
                        Ego te absolvo, et anima libera  <br>                   
                        Why? <br>
                        Ignis et sanguis in tenebris vivit lux <br><br>
    
                        In ages past, <br>
                        The Nephilim Empire ruled the Earth... but they fell from grace <br>
                        Once their slaves, humanity rose up and defeated their gods <br>
                        The Nephilim were purged from the Earth and banished to the darkness <br>
                        For centuries, they watched, and waited... <br>
                        The Nephilim Empire would one day rise again <br>
                        And, when they rose from the ashes, <br>
                        They formed an alliance with a highly-evolved race <br>
                        Known as the Konstrukts <br>
                        Together, they wiped out every last remnant of homo-sapiens DNA <br>
                        Despite the genocide, the dream of humanity would rise... again <br>
                        Time flows like a river, but there are many streams <br>
                        The end of flesh is come before me <br>
                        For the Empire is filled with violence and hatred <br>
                        Behold I will destroy the empire and those within <br>
                        I am become death, the destroyer of worlds <br><br>
    
                        Lux, Vis, Res, Is, Lux, Vita Est, <br>
                        Nova Vis, Vita Est, Nova Res, Vita Est Nova <br>
                        Ego Revoco Ad Vitam, Ad Vitam, Ad Vitam... Kreel
