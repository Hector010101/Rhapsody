                <p>
                    "It was a good time for all creatures on the earth <br>
                    But fate decreed that the dark prophecy of a demon <br>
                    Knight could bring a tragic end to this peace <br>
                    Scarring their lives forever <br><br>

                    Only one person could have crossed the darklands sorrounding Hargor <br>
                    And venture forth deep into the caves of Dar-Kunor... <br>
                    His is a name the world will never forget... <br>
                    He is Dargor!"

                    In the dark lies a secret <br>
                    His sworn to return <br>
                    To avenge the most divine world <br><br>

                    Algalord arise, greater than before <br>
                    Time of peace, not of war <br>
                    Shouts of freedom from the castle walls <br>
                    Freedom in the land and <br>
                    Hope for all <br>
                    Hope for all! <br><br>

                    Into the silent, dark and forgotten <br>
                    Caves of Dar-Dar-Kunor <br>
                    Deep in the secret book is awaiting <br>
                    Unholy warcry <br>
                    Nekron promised bloody terror <br>
                    Bringing death and hate to the new world <br><br>

                    From the rocky mountains to the golden sea <br>
                    To the barbarians' sacred hills <br>
                    From the icy north and misty lakes <br>
                    To the walls of Seth and elvish plains <br>
                    All beware! <br><br>

                    Into the silent, dark and forgotten <br>
                    Caves of Dar-Kunor <br>
                    Deep in the secret book is awaiting <br>
                    Unholy warcry <br>
                    Nekron promised bloody terror <br>
                    Bringing death and hate to the new world <br><br>

                    Torment, pain and bloody rain... Nekron's resurrection <br>
                    They must kill the demon king or fight another war <br><br>

                    "Nekron would rule in the <br>
                    Unholy name of cosmic chaos <br>
                    And this time he would reign supreme!" <br><br>

                    He is Kron, Kron's disciple <br>
                    He is sworn to return <br>
                    To avenge the lost divine wars <br><br>

                    There was only one who knew the way <br>
                    He lived in the dark, lonely caves <br>
                    The demon of the night could save the day <br>
                    Should they take a chance or run away... <br>
                    Dargor was his name! <br><br>

                    Into the silent, dark and forgotten <br>
                    Caves of Dar-Kunor <br>
                    Deep in the secret book is awaiting <br>
                    Unholy warcry <br>
                    Now they swore to band together <br>
                    On a sacred journey <br>
                    Called by fate, time to be great <br>
                    Unholy warcry <br><br>

                    Nekron promised bloody terror <br>
                    Bringing death and hate to the new world <br>
