                    <h1>ECHOES OF TRAGEDY</h1>
                    <p> Where sun creates shadow's games <br>
                        where tragic echoes speak of death why lord why <br>
                        between the ruins through lakes of holy blood <br>
                        I walk in tears for my wasted land <br><br>
    
                        Echoes of tragedy carved on my steel <br>
                        in this neverending fight against the beast <br>
                        soldiers of twilight turn back to hell <br>
                        burn in your fire or glory for me will be your end <br><br>
    
                        Mothers and children embraced in blood <br>
                        torture and rape will leave their sign <br>
                        after the sorrow I call the holy rage <br>
                        burn in my heart now flames of blind hate <br><br>
    
                        Echoes of tragedy carved on my steel <br>
                        in this neverending fight against the beast <br>
                        soldiers of twilight turn back to hell <br>
                        echoes of tragedy carved on my steel <br>
                        in this neverending fight against the beast <br>
                        soldiers of twilight turn back to hell <br>
                        burn in your fire or glory for me will be your end</p>

                    <h1>LEGENDARY TALES</h1>
                    <p> And darkness covers all the land <br>
                        the silent river flows <br>
                        the jesters dance around the flame <br>
                        playing an ancient song <br><br>
    
                        A song of mighty warriors <br>
                        of epic bloody fights <br>
                        while moonlight meets the manor's walls <br>
                        and I must close my eyes <br><br>
    
                        Another tale of infinite wars <br>
                        for the defenders of holy light <br>
                        the fire enters my mind <br>
                        the blood of the innocent before my eyes <br>
                        spreading the wings of the dream <br>
                        I want to win between fire and steel <br>
                        for them all <br><br>
    
                        Some knights sleep near fire <br>
                        drowned in their own red wine <br>
                        the elder looks at the high flame <br>
                        knowing the fight will reprise <br><br>
    
                        The magic twittering of the birds <br>
                        meets the light of dawn <br>
                        the ancient song is fading now <br>
                        but my old dream carries on <br><br>
    
                        Another tale of infinite wars <br>
                        for the defenders of holy light <br>
                        the fire enters my mind <br>

                        spreading the wings of the dream <br>
                        I want to win between fire and steel <br>
